1. Casual riders and annual members have distinct usage patterns: casual riders prioritize longer, leisure-focused rides on weekends, while annual members take shorter, frequent trips mostly on weekdays for practical purposes like commuting. To convert casual riders into members, Cyclistic can emphasize the value and convenience of memberships for leisure and daily transportation needs, potentially encouraging broader usage.

2. Digital Media Strategies:
Leverage digital channels like social media, email, and app notifications to reach casual riders with personalized offers, testimonials, and success stories from other riders who transitioned to membership.

Subscription Tier Options: Create affordable membership plans tailored for recreational riders who primarily ride on weekends.

Targeted Marketing Campaigns:
Use data-driven campaigns to highlight the benefits of membership, such as cost savings, flexibility, and additional perks like discounts for frequent users.


3. 
Define Ride Length Limits for Casual Riders:
Determine an optimal maximum ride length for casual users that gently nudges them toward membership without alienating them.
Clearly communicate these limits within the app and website to set expectations.

Introduce Weekend-Specific Promotions:
Offer trial memberships with weekend-specific perks, such as extended ride lengths, to attract casual riders who ride on weekends.
Include special events or incentives (e.g., "Weekend Unlimited Rides for Members").

Engage Casual Riders Directly:
Conduct surveys or in-app polls to understand how they perceive the new policies and perks.
Offer tailored discounts or loyalty points for casual riders showing high usage patterns.

Monitor how these changes impact overall revenue, casual rider satisfaction, and membership sign-ups.
