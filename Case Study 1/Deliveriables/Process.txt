1. I copy pasted first the start_time and end_time column and i work on the copies.

2. I converted the format of start_time and end_time to 'mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss am/pm' so that when i compute for ride length, Excel can automatically compute their difference.

3. I also made a custom format for the result of ride lengths which is 'h:mm:ss'.

4. I use Weekday() function to get the day of the week from the start time, indicating 1=Sunday to 7=Saturday.

5. Then I copy and pasted as values the columns ride_length and day_of_week so that when i delete the copy
  start_time and end_time column those values will still be available.

6. I delete the copy start_time and end_time column and also the birthyear column since it is not very useful.

7. I use SQL to select all columns with no null values then export the loaded query into a csv file to work    with.
- I use this query 
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE column1 IS NOT NULL
  AND column2 IS NOT NULL
  AND column3 IS NOT NULL
  AND column4 IS NOT NULL
  AND column5 IS NOT NULL
  AND column6 IS NOT NULL
  AND column7 IS NOT NULL
  AND column8 IS NOT NULL
  AND column9 IS NOT NULL
  AND column10 IS NOT NULL;

1. I use Excel so that it is easy to make a column for ride length and day of the week. I also use SQL because this is a large dataset and it makes it easy to select all columns with no null values and then export the resulting table.

2. Yes
